# Datatypes

The Choppy datatypes are:

- Primitives:
	- Numbers
	- Strings
	- Booleans
	- Null
	- Undefined
- Complex:
	- Arrays
	- Dictionaries

## Numbers

A Choppy number is either a integer or a float. An integer is a whole number, and a float
is a decimal.

## Strings

Strings can be literal or template strings. A literal string holds raw string data, like
the following:

<!-- The `js` Prism tag is used because the `choppy` one is incomplete -->
```js
"hello world"
'welcome to earth!'
```

On the other hand, a template string can have interpolated values. For example:

```js
`My name is ${FIRST_NAME}`
```

Literal strings can be initialized with a single quote (`'`) or double quote (`"`), but template
strings can only be initialized with a backtick (<code>`</code>).

## Booleans

A boolean can only be `true` or `false`. They are no different from any other boolean value.

## Null

`null` is a value to represent nothing. Seriously. That&apos;s it.

## Undefined

`undefined` is also a value to represent nothing. But how does it differ from `null`? `undefined`
is used when a value is **missing**, like a nonexistant dictionary value, or a nonexistant parameter.

## Array

An array is a list of values, primitive and complex. Separated by commas, each value in the array is
assigned a unique index based on it&apos;s position in the array.

In Choppy, arrays are defined with **braces**.

```js
[0, "hello world", true, null, undefined]
```

## Dictionary

A dictionary is a list of key-value pairs. Separated by commas, each key can be any primitive datatype,
while each value can be any datatype.

In Choppy, arrays are defined with **braces**.

```js
{
	key1: "hello world",
	true: false,
	a: 60
}
```
