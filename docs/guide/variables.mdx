# Variables

Variables in Choppy can be **mutable** or **immutable**. What does that mean?
A **mutable** variable is one that can be changed after initialized. Therefore, an
**immutable** variable is one that **cannot** be changed after initialization.

In Choppy, you can initialize a mutable variable with with `let` keyword

```choppy
let pi = 3.14;
```

and use `const` to initialize an immutable variable.

```choppy
const pi = 3.14;
```
