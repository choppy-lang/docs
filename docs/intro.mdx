# Introduction

Choppy is a single-threaded object-oriented interpreted general purpose language. If that made any sense
to you, great! You can skip the next section.

## What?!?

In case you didn't understand a word of that sentence, let&apos;s break it down word by word.

**single-threaded** - As Choppy is written in TypeScript (and therefore compiled down to JavaScript), it
runs on the single-threaded non-blocking event loop we call NodeJS. This means all code is synchronous and
uses a single thread to execute all code.

**object-oriented** - Choppy allows for OOP with classes. Currently, there are named constructors, destructors,
and get/set accessors.

**interpreted** - Choppy executes your code at runtime, meaning the interpreter runs through your code line by
line instead of generating an executable file for you to execute.

**general purpose** - Choppy is a general purpose language, meaning you can use it to do many things, like run
a webserver, develop a command-line application, and so on.

## How Do I Start?
